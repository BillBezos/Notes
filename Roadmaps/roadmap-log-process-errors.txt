Node version: lower it
  - add Babel
     - document new version
     - add ES modules
        - fix .eslintconfig
        - add shrimpit (redocument it)
     - make sure source maps work
        - including with nyc
  - maybe do a babel-node module??? or document rollup???
     - create one build per node.js version
        - then require() the right one at load-time using process.version
     - could use same node.js version logic as npxv (i.e. use package.json engines.node but can override)
     - maybe find a way of simpliying polyfilling Node.js API features (as opposed to JavaScript features handled by Babel)
