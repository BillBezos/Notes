Interface:
  - validatePath[.sync]()
     - return default export
     - limit possible options with sync()
     - do not return promise with sync()
  - validatePath[.sync]("PATH"|"PATH"_ARR|OBJ)->SAME
     - CLI: can pass several PATH...
     - can make the base of one option another option
        - should avoid recursion

Use validatePath on itself for opts.base
  - relative itself to process.cwd()

Figure out opts.can* for non-existing files:
  - including when must create parent directories
  - it seems like:
     - new file uses umask
     - during creation, can always write, even with lowest umask
     - creation permissions depends on parent directory
  - options:
     - can*(): if does not exist, must be able to create + umask must match
     - can*(): if does not exist, skipped. exist|canCreate(): able to create.
     - can*(): if does not exist, skipped. exist|canCreate(): able to create with write + read permissions

Character checks:
  - https://github.com/antarasi/path-validation/blob/master/README.md
  - check if should add options, or do it always
  - no null bytes

Divide some features into smaller utils
