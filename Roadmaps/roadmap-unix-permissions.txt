Fix CI and codecov

Fix Windows CI

Travis 6.5.0 not 6 (also other repos)

Add README
  - check all examples
  - fix description and examples of CLI
  - document:
     - usage with Node.js core functions: fs.stat(), umask(), chmod(), fs.writeFile()

1.0.0

Todo:
  - add `equal(permission, ...permissions)` since permissions get normalized
  - allow `all` as `object` category during parsing
     - it has lower priority
  - symbolic notation:
     - like "a+o", i.e. "o" means "permissions of o" (this is supported by Unix chmod)
     - X should be noop if "u", "g" and "o" do not have "x" and is not a directory
     - operator '=' should ignore setuid and setgid on directories
     - setgid is unset if current gid does not match
  - path type, i.e. uses same permission as this path???
     - chmod has an option for this
     - problem: async
  - using stat that starts with - with CLI fails before yargs think it's an option
