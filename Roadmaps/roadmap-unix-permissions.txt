Fix Windows CI

Todo:
  - add `equal(permission, ...permissions)` since permissions get normalized
  - allow `all` as `object` category during parsing
     - it has lower priority
  - try to think about partial vs full:
     - the fact() that full() (including through invert() or set()) adds `=` on octal is not great
     - maybe we should distinguish between `undefined` and `either false or undefined`
  - symbolic notation:
     - like "a+o", i.e. "o" means "permissions of o" (this is supported by Unix chmod)
     - X should be noop if "u", "g" and "o" do not have "x" and is not a directory
     - operator '=' should ignore setuid and setgid on directories
     - setgid is unset if current gid does not match
  - path type, i.e. uses same permission as this path???
     - chmod has an option for this
     - problem: async
  - using stat that starts with - with CLI fails before yargs think it's an option
