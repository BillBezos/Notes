Doing:
Add base for integration testing

Each combination of OPERATION + RESP + RESP.x-test-params

Think about path variables and state between tests???

RESP.x-test-params OBJ_ARR:
  - key is '[IN_]PARAM_NAME' or '[TYPE_]SEC_NAME'
  - value can be:
     - any VAL (including not specified)
     - 'any': random possible value
     - 'error': random not possible value
  - def OBJ_ARR: [{}]
  - def param value:
     - non-required query|headers and SECURITY params: undefined
     - otherwise: use possible value
     - allow overriding OBJ properties???
  - use PATHDEF|OPERATION.parameters, PARAM.name|in
     - and SPEC|OPERATION.security, SPEC.securityDefinitions:
  - should allow specifying (outside specification) SECURITY PARAMs for all requests
     - think of making it work with authentication

[Not] possible value generation:
  - generate NUM [not] possible values, where NUM is hard-coded
     - generated from [SMALL_]SCHEMA
  - if test fails, should print the generated values
  - do not create new it() for each possible value, i.e. keep inside the it() so it:
     - is less verbose: only report one success|failure
     - is faster: do not process further possible values
  - add fuzzy testing values???

HTTP request:
  - URL: use SERVER, OPERATION.schemes
     - allow overriding host|port (outside specification)

Validation:
  - RESP STATUS_CODE
  - RESP.schema
  - RESP.headers.HEADER:
     - key is present
     - value matches SCHEMA

SCHEMA (for both value generation and RESP validation):
  - remember SCHEMA it is not 100% JSON schema
  - should include PARAM.allowEmptyValue

PARAM parsing|serializing??? Including collectionFormat

Other PARAMs:
  - Content-Type [C] and Accept [C] according to SPEC|OPERATION.consumes|produces

Integration testing:
  - think of sequences of HTTP requests and states between it()
  - live vs fake database
  - server must be running
  - also test middleware (not endpoints)
  - Gulp task
  - run each it() in parallel (Promise.all())
  - Jasmine for the moment, including assertions (no Chai)
  - Frisby or swagger-js???
  - fake data
  - data-driven tests
  - fuzzy testing
  - stress testing
  - load testing
  - Jasmine-eslint
  - test coverage
  - explore test runners, reporting
  - test mocking less important for integration testing

To do:
  - make sure feature/gulp branch deploys correctly on stage
     - remove npm run lint and fix CI accordingly
     - also check if Heroku needs to be fixed
  - merge feature/openapi_parsing after feature/gulp is merged
     - this should also fix Snyk vulnerability
  - Gulp ESLint should use --max-warnings 0 --report-unused-disable-directives
  - Upgrade:
     - gulp-jasmine 4.0.0
     - jasmine-console-reporter 3.0.0
     - eslint 5.0.0-alpha.1
     - eslint-config-standard 11.0.0
     - eslint-plugin-import 2.11.0
     - eslint-plugin-node 6.0.1
     - eslint-plugin-promise 3.7.0
     - prettier 1.12.1
     - eslint-plugin-prettier 2.6.0
     - lint-staged 7.0.4
     - dotenv 5.0.1
     - ejs 2.5.8
     - express 4.16.3
     - express-useragent 1.0.12
     - helmet 3.12.0
     - joi 13.2.0
     - lodash 4.17.5
     - moment 2.22.1
     - nconf 0.10.0
     - nodemon 1.17.3
     - request 2.85.0
     - winston 2.4.1
  - use node-uuid (front-end already uses that)
  - change minimist to yargs (front-end already uses that)
  - consider if can use OpenAPI 3.0
  - integration testing, dredd
  - fix configuration, it's a little messy
     - implies learning about configuration tools first
  - Node 9
  - add Flow
  - RSS/Atom
  - generate client SDKs from OpenAPI: JavaScript, Bash, others
  - update API documentation to Widdershins
  - use JSON schema instead of joi:
     - probably using SWAY.validateRequest|Response()
     - first use JSON schema during integration testing, then suggesting merging
        - maybe use enjoi as transition
     - possible advantages of JSON schemas:
        - declarative:
           - can be communicated to clients so they can validate before sending to APIs
              - there are even library to generate <form> and <input>
           - schema is data not code, i.e. easier to manipulate for other purpose
              - e.g. can be used for auto-documentation
        - we do not want to be loose on validation with sanitization, but fail hard instead
           - joi is built as sanitizer, e.g. every validation creates a deep copy
        - not JavaScript-specific
        - https://github.com/icebob/validator-benchmark
     - also validate response
     - also parse request parameters
  - replace server-driven populating by client-driven populating:
     - first refactor populating so that each route declaratively specify which models to populate instead of
       doing it imperatively
     - then let clients decide it with a query parameter instead of declaring it on the routes
     - same for:
       - filter
       - aggregation
       - pagination
       - sorting
       - population
  - generate Mongoose models from OpenAPI specification
  - add GraphQL:
     - swagger-to-graphql would allow automating it while still supporting REST
  - other possible uses of OpenAPI:
     - server-side routing
     - web automation
     - mock server
  - yamllint

To do (front-end app):
  - keep .editorconfig in sync with back-end one

Ideas:
  - gamification:
     - simple overall/aggregate ranking number
     - widget/badges showing "certified by"
     - rankings, "best of the week"
     - think of potentialpark
