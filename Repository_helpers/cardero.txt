*Done today*

_Users_
  - users can now change their email address. A new email verification code will be sent.

_Sheets_
  - Add tests to check that main Sheets are created when Users get created

_Error logging_
  - Fix mail errors not being properly logged
  - Fix logging of errors that are strings (as oppose to proper `Error`)

_Testing_
  - Do not send emails during tests

To do:
  - `GET /icos/byUrl` -> `GET /icos?url`?
  - User:
     - passwordResetToken: use hash as well
     - merge `/account` into `/users`
     - database migration (add to migations.md):
        - db.getCollection('users').updateMany({ passwordResetToken: null }, { $unset: { passwordResetToken: "" } })
        - db.getCollection('users').updateMany({ lastVerificationCodeSentAt: { $exists: true } }, { $unset: { lastVerificationCodeSentAt: "" } })
        - db.getCollection('users').updateMany({ phoneNumberCountryCode: { $exists: true } }, { $unset: { phoneNumberCountryCode: "" } })
        - db.getCollection('users').updateMany({ registrationToken: { $exists: true } }, { $unset: { registrationToken: "" } })
        - redo migration of `User.slugs`, as new users might have been created, or existing ones changing their displayName
     - divide userService into several files
     - creating|updating User.email should set `isEmailVerified: false`
     - add API documentation about `isAdmin` check on `/tags`, `/metrics` `/users` endpoints
     - `User.registrationToken` default value should be set by service, not by schema
     - User pictures upload: re-use logic from ICO logos uploads
     - check passport and authentication
     - users should not be cached by passport as they might be updated
     - why is `GET /users?q` test randomly failing? Seems like index is not properly built by Mongoose
     - fix users indexes (which ones should be used or not)
     - update front-end branch for Users account page
  - rename optional.yml to update.yml and required.yml to create.yml
  - rate limiting:
     - general improvement
     - too low when sending `phoneNumberCode`
     - too higher when updating other `User` attributes, e.g. description
  - improve emails code
     - config.appPublicUrl should change by environment
  - API logging
  - Anton goodbye list
  - `GET /icos?select=ATTR`
     - add to other endpoints as well
  - Feed:
     - current Feed vs Post|Sheet division is not right:
        - not being able to filter|sort by Feed.content.* or Post|Sheet.feedItem.* is too restrictive, e.g.:
           - fetch popular posts for a given ICO
           - Feed text search on Post description
           - do not show unlisted/private Posts|Sheets in `GET /posts|sheets`
     - do not populate `Post.icos[*].ico` on `GET /posts` (but do it on `GET /posts/:id`)
        - need to do client changes as well
     - fix `populateMany()` helper so that it preserves sorting order
        - fix the places that use it and currently have to re-sort
  - pagination info:
     - make `GET /posts|sheets|feed` return pagination info instead of a top-level array
        - only do it if `?pagination` query parameter is used (for backward compatibility)
        - then submit PR and tell Dmitry to update client
           - client should stop showing `Show more` button in Feed
        - remove backward compatibility after clients have updated
  - Sheet:
     - add `ICO.userData.sheets`
     - `Sheet` automatic adding feature
        - should perform database migrations to re-actively do it on current users
  - tests, API documentation and refactoring for `/icos` endpoints
  - learn latest MongoDB and upgrade it
  - finish branch feature/errors_v2
     - also fix errors in API documentation
     - do not report local errors to Sentry, only stage and production
  - fix deleted ICOs still showing up: https://trello.com/c/rQuTpeyV/86-deleted-icos-are-still-available-in-the-ico-details-page-url. Proposal:
     - `ICO.state` can be set to `draft`, `public`, `hidden` or `deleted` with `PUT /icos/:icoId`
        - when an `ICO` is created, `ICO.state` defaults to `draft`
        - it is eventually published by setting `ICO.state` to `public`
        - it can then be deleted or hidden by setting `ICO.state` to `deleted|hidden`
     - updating `ICO.state` can only be done by Admins or DES specialists.
        - ICO owners can make an ICO edit request though
     - neither the `ICO` nor any of its related data is never removed from the database.
     - modifying an ICO (`PUT`, `POST`, `DELETE`, `PATCH`) should return `400` (i.e. read-only) if `ICO.state` is `deleted`. Other `ICO.state` do not have that restriction
     - `GET` a deleted/draft/hidden `ICO` by ID/slug should return `404` unless `?state=["draft|public|hidden|deleted", ...]` query parameter is used (default: `['public']`)
     - `GET` several `ICO`s should skip deleted/draft/hidden ICOs unless `?state=["draft|public|hidden|deleted", ...]` query parameter is used (default: `['public']`)
     - this is for any ICOs requests, whether being top-level on `/icos` or as a nested attribute within another route/model.
     - When it comes to the front-end, it should use `?state` parameter depending on the use case:
        - ICO lists vs calendar vs main listing page vs etc.
        - front-end app vs admin app
        - etc. (edited)
  - improve body parsing:
     - e.g. errors (payload too large) trigger 500
  - blog post about test-openapi
  - integration testing
     - also test middleware (not only endpoints)
  - refactoring:
     - make status codes more consistent and hide behind a common interface
     - refactor authentication to simplify it
  - migrations:
     - check production database matches our data model (perform live queries to fix it otherwise)
     - automated system that syncs staging database with production database
     - system to perform and test migrations against production database
  - add a model layer between controller and Mongoose:
     - provide caching invalidation functionality
     - provide ICO slug update functionality
     - make any DELETE flag the model as deleted, but not removed from database
  - upgrade node.bcrypt.js to fix security vulnerability (when they release a version)
  - Gulp buildwatch crashes (does not watch anymore) after the first OpenAPI error
  - switch Jasmine to Jest, like in front-end
  - add Flow
  - RSS/Atom
  - generate client SDKs from OpenAPI: JavaScript, Bash, others
 Â - replace current dependency REQUEST by CROSS-FETCH
  - lint-staged currently does not allow committing only half of a file
  - use declarative way (with JSON-SCHEMA-MOCKER) instead of current approach for populating scripts
  - create fake|test database from OpenAPI:
     - can maybe specify in OpenAPI if a specific type of data is prefered
        - e.g. at least one user should be admin
        - can use faker, etc.
     - can replace populating scripts
     - can be merged with the test populating task at beginning of integration tests
  - use JSON schema instead of joi:
     - probably using SWAY.validateRequest|Response()
     - first use JSON schema during integration testing, then suggesting merging
        - maybe use enjoi as transition
     - possible advantages of JSON schemas:
        - declarative:
           - can be communicated to clients so they can validate before sending to APIs
              - there are even library to generate <form> and <input>
           - schema is data not code, i.e. easier to manipulate for other purpose
              - e.g. can be used for auto-documentation
        - we do not want to be loose on validation with sanitization, but fail hard instead
           - joi is built as sanitizer, e.g. every validation creates a deep copy
        - not JavaScript-specific
        - https://github.com/icebob/validator-benchmark
     - also validate response
     - also parse request parameters
  - replace server-driven populating by client-driven populating:
     - first refactor populating so that each route declaratively specify which models to populate instead of
       doing it imperatively
     - then let clients decide it with a query parameter instead of declaring it on the routes
     - same for:
       - filter
       - aggregation
       - pagination
       - sorting
       - population
  - generate Mongoose models from OpenAPI specification
  - add GraphQL:
     - swagger-to-graphql would allow automating it while still supporting REST
     - I estimated it at 2 days of work
  - other possible uses of OpenAPI:
     - server-side routing
     - web automation
     - mock server
  - yamllint

To do (front-end app):
  - keep .editorconfig in sync with back-end one

Ideas:
  - gamification:
     - simple overall/aggregate ranking number
     - widget/badges showing "certified by"
     - rankings, "best of the week"
     - think of potentialpark
