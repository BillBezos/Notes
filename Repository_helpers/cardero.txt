Doing:
Add base for integration testing
Fix several problems with swagger-jsdoc with pull requests

Dredd:
  - to do:
     - state between requests
     - live vs fake database
     - authentication and OpenAPI security defs
     - host|port in different environments
     - server must be running
     - maybe check logLevel
     - Gulp task
  - should also test:
     - middleware (not endpoints)
     - error responses
     - different values of parameters
     - sequences of request|responses

To do:
  - make sure feature/gulp branch deploys correctly on stage
     - remove npm run lint and fix CI accordingly
     - also check if Heroku needs to be fixed
  - create Gulp task to replace swagger-jsdoc with simpler (because do not use JSDoc comments parsing)
     - also it fixes swagger-jsdoc leaving JSON references, then redoc does not completely handle JSON references, e.g. for responses
        - dredd also has issues there
     - this will also remove the Snyk vulnerability
     - simply resolve JSON references from top.yml instead of finding then merging all YAML files
        - using sway
        - then write the two final files
        - organize under specification/responses|schemas|routes|tags/*.yml
     - store in specification/dist/ (also docs.html)
        - symlink src/static/ to them
        - change .gitignore
     - should validate OpenAPI
  - integration testing, dredd
  - fix configuration, it's a little messy
     - implies learning about configuration tools first
  - use node-uuid (front-end already uses that)
  - change minimist to yargs (front-end already uses that)
  - Node 9
  - add Flow
  - RSS/Atom
  - use JSON schema instead of joi:
     - first use JSON schema during integration testing, then suggesting merging
        - maybe use enjoi as transition
     - possible advantages of JSON schemas:
        - declarative:
           - can be communicated to clients so they can validate before sending to APIs
              - there are even library to generate <form> and <input>
           - schema is data not code, i.e. easier to manipulate for other purpose
              - e.g. can be used for auto-documentation
        - we do not want to be loose on validation with sanitization, but fail hard instead
           - joi is built as sanitizer, e.g. every validation creates a deep copy
        - not JavaScript-specific
        - https://github.com/icebob/validator-benchmark
  - replace server-driven populating by client-driven populating:
     - first refactor populating so that each route declaratively specify which models to populate instead of
       doing it imperatively
     - then let clients decide it with a query parameter instead of declaring it on the routes
     - same for:
       - filter
       - aggregation
       - pagination
       - sorting
       - population
  - yamllint

To do (front-end app):
  - keep .editorconfig in sync with back-end one

Ideas:
  - gamification:
     - simple overall/aggregate ranking number
     - widget/badges showing "certified by"
     - rankings, "best of the week"
     - think of potentialpark
