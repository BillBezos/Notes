Upgrade joi 13.3.0

Integration testing:
  - remember that OpenAPI schema and JSON schema v4 "type" can be an array
     - check code to see if it takes it into account
     - including JSON schema faker
  - generate any param if and only if both:
     - either PARAM.required true or param is specified in testOpts
        - "specified in testOpts": including empty object
     - and PARAM.type is not "null"
        - type ['null', ...] means randomly either generated or not
  - null:
     - "type" null means "not set" (as opposed to "set to null")
        - parameter: mean not generated
        - response headers|body:
           - type "null": must not be defined
           - type ["null", ...]: optional
           - key is defined but not "type": required
           - key is not defined: skipped / not validated
              - i.e. including response headers|body present in actual response but not in expected (spec or testOpts)
        - for top-level only, not for nested properties
     - "const" null: same as "type" null
     - think about 'invalid'??? it will probably imply "type": ["null", ...]
  - optionalsProbability should be 0, i.e. optionals are never generated
     - when a request.* parameter is specified to anything but null, it becomes required (i.e. generated)
     - if set to null, becomes non-required
  - test file:
     - instead of x-tests.*
     - format YAML or JSON file
     - "OperationId.TestName" (single key):
        - request|response: ...
  - test files input instead of x-tests.*:
     - test-openapi FILE...
     - FILE can include (escaped) globbing
        - reason: can be used in a config file even without shell globbing
     - FILE are shallow merged
  - DepTest:
     - DEPTEST is 'OperationId.TestName.request|response.*[.VARR]"
     - DEPTEST can be a value anywhere in testOpts
     - during testOpt creation, crawl it and set TEST.depTests { DEPTEST: VARR_ARR, ... } where VARR is where it is in testOpt
     - just before each repeated test run:
        - create depTestsInfo { resolved {}, ancestors [] } (only if top-level in recursion)
        - find all unique dependent tests using TEST.depTests
           - remember OperationId, TestName, parameter name, response headers name can contain dots
        - if some are already in depTestsInfo.ancestors, throw infinite recursion error (error message should print the cycle)
           - otherwise add current to ancestors (by copy)
        - for each dependent test:
           - depTestsInfo.resolved['OperationId.TestName']:
              - if undefined, call that test (should return parameters, response and response headers), and set its promise
                 - do it by reference so concurrent requests can share information (if they belong to same top-level test)
              - if defined, use it instead directly
              - depTestsInfo should be different for each top-level test, i.e. no sharing of info between them
        - await all dependent promises (using Promise.all())
        - if any promise was rejected, skip current test (as opposed to making it fail)
        - use those values to replace (by copy) current test.*, using TEST.depTests information (and Lodash set())
           - remember OperationId, TestName, parameter name, response headers name can contain dots
  - validation:
     - all validation should be done before testing start
        - i.e. when "tests" variable is built, errors should be thrown. Not in a separate step.
        - have a well-defined error format, including:
           - error.type
           - error.testPath
           - error.specPath
     - should allow dryRun:
        - i.e. only validate format
        - available as export function and as CLI command
        - use it by api-service on gulp build
     - validate:
        - is OBJ
        - `operationId.testName`
        - only known properties, e.g. request|response
        - corresponding PARAM_NAME|SEC_NAME and response headers exists
        - valid JSON schemas v4
        - should verify that response.status is:
           - type integer
           - among possible status codes for that operation (parsing enum|minimum|etc.)
        - just after DepTest has been replaced, validates TEST's schemas values are valid JSON schema v4
        - testOpts value
     - should validate input (options)
     - should validate OpenAPI specification input
  - test running:
     - should run NUM it() in parallel
        - NUM = OPTS.maxParallel / OPTS.repeat
        - in different microloops (for async parallelism)
        - in different processes (for CPU parallelism) (not as important)
        - maybe switch to ava to get that
        - should stop on failure if OPTS.stopOnFail true (def)
     - pass options to underlying test runner, e.g. reporters, reporting options, include|exclude, etc.
        - all those concerns should be offloaded to the test runner
        - maybe add OPTS.runner to choose between different runners (i.e. they would be adapters)
        - maybe force a specific runner???
        - maybe only allow specific runner options???
        - maybe force output to TAP format to allow different reporters???
     - probably:
        - use library to maintain NUM workers, where NUM is number of CPU cores
        - assign equal number of it() to each
           - they each spawn the same test file, but with a modulo to filter which tests they define
        - force a specific test runner:
           - should allow concurrent tests to have a maxParallel limit
           - should have lots of features, which should be directly accessible (and whitelisted) from user perspective
           - should report in TAP format, and add --reporter=MODULE option that points to tap reporter
  - connect to CI
  - response body parsing:
     - should still:
        - parse according to Content-Type [S]
        - default to leaving it as is (i.e. as string)
     - add parsing for x-www-url-encoded (using QUERYSTRING) as an OBJ
        - use body-parser library instead???
     - Content-Type multipart/form-data (using another library) as an OBJ
  - payloads:
     - add support for formData PARAM:
        - uses { PARAM_NAME: generatedValue, ... }
        - there can be several PARAMs of that type
        - Content-Type can only be x-www-form-urlencoded or multipart/form-data (already implemented)
        - use same stringifiers as body PARAMs
     - add PARAMs stringifiers for x-www-form-urlencoded and multipart/form-data:
        - PARAM must be an OBJ:
           - for body: [SMALL_]SCHEMA.type must be 'object'
           - for formData: it is always an OBJ
        - if formData, multipart/form-data and SMALL_SCHEMA.type 'file', add parameter filename="PARAM_NAME"
        - do not set multipart/form-data parameter Content-Type
     - [SMALL_]SCHEMA.type 'file':
        - before passing to OPENAPI-SCHEMA-TO-JSON-SCHEMA (which throws on them) should convert to:
           - if RESP.schema.type 'object'
           - if PARAM: try to guess type from siblings. If cannot guess, use 'string'
  - OpenAPI conformance:
     - add support for PARAM.allowEmptyValue in parameter generation
     - add OpenAPI "format"s
        - to ajv
        - to JSON-SCHEMA-FAKER
  - add fuzzy testing values???
     - maybe propose as an option to JSON-SCHEMA-FAKER???
  - during stopServer(), should delete database
  - also test middleware (not endpoints)
  - timeout might be too high to detect actual timeouts
  - add support for $data in x-tests JSON schemas
     - should be able to target merged response body, response headers, request
       parameters and security
  - should Accept [C|S] be required???
  - Explore:
     - test runners, reporting
     - fuzzy testing
     - stress testing
     - load testing
     - test coverage
  - To improve???
     - reduce amount of mocking needed by users
     - reduce amount of setup and teardown (e.g. starting server) needed by users
  - better way to set configuration and options
  - produce code coverage report
  - exceptions due to bugs (not to test fails) should produce stack trace and error messages
  - divide repository into smaller modules: request building, response validation, etc.
  - schemes:
     - support over protocols than HTTP
        - including WebSocket
     - support OPERATION.schemes
     - unless OPTS.endpoint was given, should randomly pick protocol among SPEC|OPERATION.schemes for each test
  - security:
     - add support for HTTP authentication
     - add support for OAuth2
  - add support for OpenAPI 3.0:
     - only blocker is the use of sway
  - add support for RAML, API blueprint
  - load test file re-using same logic as autoserver to allow many formats
  - dynamic properties keys:
     - problematic on parameter generation and response validation
        - for parameter name, response header names, OpenAPI schema properties
        - OpenAPI only allows static keys
     - possible solution:
        - use 'REGEXP' for keys
        - transform to patternProperties instead of properties
           - both ajv and JSON-SCHEMA-FAKER should then handle it correctly
        - how to mark that a key is a REGEXP not a STR??? Possible solutions:
           - all keys are REGEXPs
           - "/.../" key
           - global OPT
           - testOpt
           - property in specification, e.g. x-*
        - need to work with other specification formats too
  - add configuration file and logic:
     - re-use same logic as autoserver
  - check autoserver for feature suggestions:
     - including special linting tool
  - JSON schema v7:
     - allow v7 in OpenAPI SCHEMA
     - problems:
        - not supported by OpenAPI yet, i.e. OPENAPI-SCHEMA-TO-JSON-SCHEMA outputs JSON schema v4, but this is not a problem
        - however does not work with JSON-SCHEMA-FAKER yet
  - cancel other sub-tests once one sub-test failed:
     - including HTTP request using AbortController:
        - not supported by node-fetch yet: https://github.com/bitinn/node-fetch/pull/437
     - including writing request bodies and reading response bodies (abort STREAMs)
  - allow [SMALL_]SCHEMA.x-validate:
     - custom validation similar to autoserver's
     - needs to be added to AJV
     - problem with JSON-SCHEMA-FAKER:
        - not supported as is
        - might be even harder when it comes to combining with not|allOf|anyOf|oneOf

To do:
  - integration testing
  - fix Snyk vulnerability
  - Gulp buildwatch crashes (does not watch anymore) after the first OpenAPI error
  - OpenAPI 3.0:
     - blockers: sway, client generation libraries
  - switch Jasmine to Jest, like in front-end
  - use declarative way (with JSON-SCHEMA-MOCKER) instead of current approach for populating scripts
  - Node 10
  - 404 are HTML even in JSON
  - fix configuration, it's a little messy
     - implies learning about configuration tools first
  - add Flow
  - RSS/Atom
  - generate client SDKs from OpenAPI: JavaScript, Bash, others
  - update API documentation to Widdershins
  - replace current dependency REQUEST by CROSS-FETCH
  - lint-staged currently does not allow committing only half of a file
  - create fake|test database from OpenAPI:
     - can maybe specify in OpenAPI if a specific type of data is prefered
        - e.g. at least one user should be admin
        - can use faker, etc.
     - can replace populating scripts
     - can be merged with the test populating task at beginning of integration tests
  - use JSON schema instead of joi:
     - probably using SWAY.validateRequest|Response()
     - first use JSON schema during integration testing, then suggesting merging
        - maybe use enjoi as transition
     - possible advantages of JSON schemas:
        - declarative:
           - can be communicated to clients so they can validate before sending to APIs
              - there are even library to generate <form> and <input>
           - schema is data not code, i.e. easier to manipulate for other purpose
              - e.g. can be used for auto-documentation
        - we do not want to be loose on validation with sanitization, but fail hard instead
           - joi is built as sanitizer, e.g. every validation creates a deep copy
        - not JavaScript-specific
        - https://github.com/icebob/validator-benchmark
     - also validate response
     - also parse request parameters
  - replace server-driven populating by client-driven populating:
     - first refactor populating so that each route declaratively specify which models to populate instead of
       doing it imperatively
     - then let clients decide it with a query parameter instead of declaring it on the routes
     - same for:
       - filter
       - aggregation
       - pagination
       - sorting
       - population
  - generate Mongoose models from OpenAPI specification
  - add GraphQL:
     - swagger-to-graphql would allow automating it while still supporting REST
     - I estimated it at 2 days of work
  - other possible uses of OpenAPI:
     - server-side routing
     - web automation
     - mock server
  - yamllint

To do (front-end app):
  - keep .editorconfig in sync with back-end one

Ideas:
  - gamification:
     - simple overall/aggregate ranking number
     - widget/badges showing "certified by"
     - rankings, "best of the week"
     - think of potentialpark
