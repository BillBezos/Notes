To do:
  - go through marketing stuff: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BjRSv5uHkIzTaTlfQQP0q4y1bssKeT9G1-iLfDLjvVw/edit#gid=0
  - Feed:
     - `Feed.userData.saved`
        - some tests seem to randomly fail (maybe not related to skipped tests, so might be able to remove `skip` from those)
     - `Posts` bug: https://monosnap.com/file/PqXqW6LGNbauMMIEFO0AQjcIkfZfkN and Trello card
     - `Feed.ratings`:
        - move from `Post.ratings`
        - should not be in separate collection
        - updating them should not update `Post|Sheet.updatedAt`
     - Feed sorting
  - On Wednesday: remove `Post.isPublic`
     - merge back-end PR
     - perform migration on production
  - Sheet:
     - add `ICO.userData.sheets`
     - database indexes
     - `Sheet` automatic adding feature
        - should perform database migrations to re-actively do it on current users
  - use `$lookup` everywhere in the endpoints I've tested and documented, instead of `populate()`
  - ICOS:
     - `GET /icos?url`
     - `GET /icos?url=FULL_URL`
        - filter according to algorithm:
            // `GET /icos?url=http://www.example.co.uk:80/path?query#hash` -> ['www', 'example', 'co', 'uk']
            const hostnameParts = getHostname(query.url).split('.')

            // Iterate over full hostname, removing one subdomain at a time
            for (const i = 0; i < hostnameParts.length; i++) {
              const hostname = hostnameParts.slice(i).join('.')

              // We did not find any matches
              // TLDs can have dots in them, e.g. `.co.uk`
              if (isTopLevelDomain(hostname)) { return [] }

              const matchingIcos = icos.filter(ico => getHostname(ico.url).endsWith(hostname))
              if (matchingIcos.length !== 0) { return matchingIcos }
            }
        - probably run algorithm in reverse because of higher probably of returning nothing
        - note that `ICO.url` can be null
     - remove bookmark feature
  - tests, API documentation and refactoring for `/icos` endpoints
  - learn latest MongoDB and upgrade it
  - finish branch feature/errors_v2
     - also fix errors in API documentation
     - do not report local errors to Sentry, only stage and production
  - fix deleted ICOs still showing up: https://trello.com/c/rQuTpeyV/86-deleted-icos-are-still-available-in-the-ico-details-page-url. Proposal:
     - `ICO.state` can be set to `draft`, `public`, `hidden` or `deleted` with `PUT /icos/:icoId`
        - when an `ICO` is created, `ICO.state` defaults to `draft`
        - it is eventually published by setting `ICO.state` to `public`
        - it can then be deleted or hidden by setting `ICO.state` to `deleted|hidden`
     - updating `ICO.state` can only be done by Admins or DES specialists.
        - ICO owners can make an ICO edit request though
     - neither the `ICO` nor any of its related data is never removed from the database.
     - modifying an ICO (`PUT`, `POST`, `DELETE`, `PATCH`) should return `400` (i.e. read-only) if `ICO.state` is `deleted`. Other `ICO.state` do not have that restriction
     - `GET` a deleted/draft/hidden `ICO` by ID/slug should return `404` unless `?state=["draft|public|hidden|deleted", ...]` query parameter is used (default: `['public']`)
     - `GET` several `ICO`s should skip deleted/draft/hidden ICOs unless `?state=["draft|public|hidden|deleted", ...]` query parameter is used (default: `['public']`)
     - this is for any ICOs requests, whether being top-level on `/icos` or as a nested attribute within another route/model.
     - When it comes to the front-end, it should use `?state` parameter depending on the use case:
        - ICO lists vs calendar vs main listing page vs etc.
        - front-end app vs admin app
        - etc. (edited)
  - API documentation:
     - allow toggling endpoints according to role (admin, DES, ICO owner, premium, normal)
  - blog post about test-openapi
  - integration testing
     - also test middleware (not only endpoints)
  - refactoring:
     - make status codes more consistent and hide behind a common interface
     - refactor authentication to simplify it
  - migrations:
     - check production database matches our data model (perform live queries to fix it otherwise)
     - automated system that syncs staging database with production database
     - system to perform and test migrations against production database
  - add a model layer between controller and Mongoose:
     - provide caching invalidation functionality
     - provide ICO slug update functionality
     - make any DELETE flag the model as deleted, but not removed from database
  - upgrade node.bcrypt.js to fix security vulnerability (when they release a version)
  - Gulp buildwatch crashes (does not watch anymore) after the first OpenAPI error
  - switch Jasmine to Jest, like in front-end
  - add Flow
  - RSS/Atom
  - generate client SDKs from OpenAPI: JavaScript, Bash, others
 Â - replace current dependency REQUEST by CROSS-FETCH
  - lint-staged currently does not allow committing only half of a file
  - use declarative way (with JSON-SCHEMA-MOCKER) instead of current approach for populating scripts
  - create fake|test database from OpenAPI:
     - can maybe specify in OpenAPI if a specific type of data is prefered
        - e.g. at least one user should be admin
        - can use faker, etc.
     - can replace populating scripts
     - can be merged with the test populating task at beginning of integration tests
  - use JSON schema instead of joi:
     - probably using SWAY.validateRequest|Response()
     - first use JSON schema during integration testing, then suggesting merging
        - maybe use enjoi as transition
     - possible advantages of JSON schemas:
        - declarative:
           - can be communicated to clients so they can validate before sending to APIs
              - there are even library to generate <form> and <input>
           - schema is data not code, i.e. easier to manipulate for other purpose
              - e.g. can be used for auto-documentation
        - we do not want to be loose on validation with sanitization, but fail hard instead
           - joi is built as sanitizer, e.g. every validation creates a deep copy
        - not JavaScript-specific
        - https://github.com/icebob/validator-benchmark
     - also validate response
     - also parse request parameters
  - replace server-driven populating by client-driven populating:
     - first refactor populating so that each route declaratively specify which models to populate instead of
       doing it imperatively
     - then let clients decide it with a query parameter instead of declaring it on the routes
     - same for:
       - filter
       - aggregation
       - pagination
       - sorting
       - population
  - generate Mongoose models from OpenAPI specification
  - add GraphQL:
     - swagger-to-graphql would allow automating it while still supporting REST
     - I estimated it at 2 days of work
  - other possible uses of OpenAPI:
     - server-side routing
     - web automation
     - mock server
  - yamllint

To do (front-end app):
  - keep .editorconfig in sync with back-end one

Ideas:
  - gamification:
     - simple overall/aggregate ranking number
     - widget/badges showing "certified by"
     - rankings, "best of the week"
     - think of potentialpark
