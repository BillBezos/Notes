Done today:
  - ratings feature:
     - check, update and re-organize all ratings-related cards on Trello
     - check bugs:
        - "Ratings are different depending on the view" (now fixed) (https://trello.com/c/zmI2MsKW/70-ratings-are-different-depending-on-the-view)
        - "ICOs showing up with high ratings unexpectedly" https://trello.com/c/nmVOfp2m/78-ratings-bug-icos-showing-up-with-high-ratings-unexpectedly
        - "RatingsReportMinValue value not showing in admin-panel" https://trello.com/c/OJk6fDJP/80-ratingsreportminvalue-value-not-showing-in-admin-panel
     - ICO.scoreMinUsersToShow:
        - merge API PR and deploy to production
        - merge `admin` PR and deploy to production
        - database migration (stage and production): remove `ICO.scoreMinUsersToShow`
  - spend lots of time understanding ICO filtering code in ordering to fix related bugs
  - upgrade deps: eslint

Plans:
  - adds Phone verification to ratings calculation
  - fix ICO filtering related bugs
  - jump on ICO Lists feature

  - refactor icoService filtering, code is terrible
  - add tests for score calculation (unit tests?)
  - List:
     - finish refactoring
     - add all tests
     - fix OpenAPI security / access token documentation for those endpoints
     - all `List` should return counts in the same consistent way, i.e. as `List.likesCount|dislikesCount|rankingScore` (no more nested `ratings`)
        - ask Scott to help with new shape in the front-end
     - bug:
        1. Being logged in, open any list with no likes / dislikes
        2. Try to set a like
        3. Refresh the page, expected counts: `likes: 1, dislikes: 0`; actual counts: `likes: 1, dislikes: 1`
  - bug fixes:
     - search improvement: https://trello.com/c/VDh79tAJ/95-search-algorithm-on-public-site-not-returning-an-exact-match
     - any other important ones on Trello
  - blog post about test-openapi
  - integration testing
     - also test middleware (not only endpoints)
  - refactoring:
     - make status codes more consistent and hide behind a common interface
     - refactor authentication to simplify it
  - migrations:
     - check production database matches our data model (perform live queries to fix it otherwise)
     - automated system that syncs staging database with production database
     - system to perform and test migrations against production database
  - add a model layer between controller and Mongoose:
     - provide caching invalidation functionality
     - provide ICO slug update functionality
     - make any DELETE flag the model as deleted, but not removed from database
  - upgrade node.bcrypt.js to fix security vulnerability (when they release a version)
  - Gulp buildwatch crashes (does not watch anymore) after the first OpenAPI error
  - switch Jasmine to Jest, like in front-end
  - Node 10
  - 404 are HTML even in JSON
  - add Flow
  - RSS/Atom
  - generate client SDKs from OpenAPI: JavaScript, Bash, others
  - update API documentation to Widdershins
 Â - replace current dependency REQUEST by CROSS-FETCH
  - lint-staged currently does not allow committing only half of a file
  - use declarative way (with JSON-SCHEMA-MOCKER) instead of current approach for populating scripts
  - create fake|test database from OpenAPI:
     - can maybe specify in OpenAPI if a specific type of data is prefered
        - e.g. at least one user should be admin
        - can use faker, etc.
     - can replace populating scripts
     - can be merged with the test populating task at beginning of integration tests
  - use JSON schema instead of joi:
     - probably using SWAY.validateRequest|Response()
     - first use JSON schema during integration testing, then suggesting merging
        - maybe use enjoi as transition
     - possible advantages of JSON schemas:
        - declarative:
           - can be communicated to clients so they can validate before sending to APIs
              - there are even library to generate <form> and <input>
           - schema is data not code, i.e. easier to manipulate for other purpose
              - e.g. can be used for auto-documentation
        - we do not want to be loose on validation with sanitization, but fail hard instead
           - joi is built as sanitizer, e.g. every validation creates a deep copy
        - not JavaScript-specific
        - https://github.com/icebob/validator-benchmark
     - also validate response
     - also parse request parameters
  - replace server-driven populating by client-driven populating:
     - first refactor populating so that each route declaratively specify which models to populate instead of
       doing it imperatively
     - then let clients decide it with a query parameter instead of declaring it on the routes
     - same for:
       - filter
       - aggregation
       - pagination
       - sorting
       - population
  - generate Mongoose models from OpenAPI specification
  - add GraphQL:
     - swagger-to-graphql would allow automating it while still supporting REST
     - I estimated it at 2 days of work
  - other possible uses of OpenAPI:
     - server-side routing
     - web automation
     - mock server
  - yamllint

To do (front-end app):
  - keep .editorconfig in sync with back-end one

Ideas:
  - gamification:
     - simple overall/aggregate ranking number
     - widget/badges showing "certified by"
     - rankings, "best of the week"
     - think of potentialpark
