To do:
  - `populatedev` for lists and popular lists
  - integration testing
     - also test middleware (not only endpoints)
  - refactorings:
     - make status codes more consistent and hide behind a common interface
     - refactor authentication to simplify it
  - Gulp buildwatch crashes (does not watch anymore) after the first OpenAPI error
  - switch Jasmine to Jest, like in front-end
  - Node 10
  - 404 are HTML even in JSON
  - add Flow
  - RSS/Atom
  - generate client SDKs from OpenAPI: JavaScript, Bash, others
  - update API documentation to Widdershins
 Â - replace current dependency REQUEST by CROSS-FETCH
  - lint-staged currently does not allow committing only half of a file
  - use declarative way (with JSON-SCHEMA-MOCKER) instead of current approach for populating scripts
  - create fake|test database from OpenAPI:
     - can maybe specify in OpenAPI if a specific type of data is prefered
        - e.g. at least one user should be admin
        - can use faker, etc.
     - can replace populating scripts
     - can be merged with the test populating task at beginning of integration tests
  - use JSON schema instead of joi:
     - probably using SWAY.validateRequest|Response()
     - first use JSON schema during integration testing, then suggesting merging
        - maybe use enjoi as transition
     - possible advantages of JSON schemas:
        - declarative:
           - can be communicated to clients so they can validate before sending to APIs
              - there are even library to generate <form> and <input>
           - schema is data not code, i.e. easier to manipulate for other purpose
              - e.g. can be used for auto-documentation
        - we do not want to be loose on validation with sanitization, but fail hard instead
           - joi is built as sanitizer, e.g. every validation creates a deep copy
        - not JavaScript-specific
        - https://github.com/icebob/validator-benchmark
     - also validate response
     - also parse request parameters
  - replace server-driven populating by client-driven populating:
     - first refactor populating so that each route declaratively specify which models to populate instead of
       doing it imperatively
     - then let clients decide it with a query parameter instead of declaring it on the routes
     - same for:
       - filter
       - aggregation
       - pagination
       - sorting
       - population
  - generate Mongoose models from OpenAPI specification
  - add GraphQL:
     - swagger-to-graphql would allow automating it while still supporting REST
     - I estimated it at 2 days of work
  - other possible uses of OpenAPI:
     - server-side routing
     - web automation
     - mock server
  - yamllint

To do (front-end app):
  - keep .editorconfig in sync with back-end one

Ideas:
  - gamification:
     - simple overall/aggregate ranking number
     - widget/badges showing "certified by"
     - rankings, "best of the week"
     - think of potentialpark
