To do:
  - upgrade:
     - ESLint 5.3.0
  - List:
     - on Monday, merge feature/normalize_counts and deploy to production
     - make routes more RESTful:
        - replace `List.items` OBJ_ARR by `icos` ID_ARR
        - document `List.items._id` where it's available
        - either validate or remove duplicate List.items
        - bug: clicking on a list from an ICO page (ICO lists tab) seems to crash
     - front-end bug:
        - ICO that have already been added to a list still show up in "Add ICO" dropdown on /my-lists
     - `/lists/popular` retrieve all lists then do sorting/paginating at the database level.
       It should instead sort/paginate as part of the database query.
     - improve performance of `GET /lists`, especially `GET /lists?order=populatedField`
        - maybe UserListRating should be nested inside List, i.e. no need to populate
           - e.g. `List.votes` OBJ_ARR: { _id, user, rating }
           - on update, calculate and set List.ratings and List.userData.rating
              - should not allow user setting it themselves
     - create a shared populating utility
     - once API documentation for `Lists` is in production, ask for feedback on API documentation since now `List` and
       `Metrics` are fully documented
     - remove `enum: [..., null]` after openapi-schema-to-json-schema released on npm
  - integrationTestWatch should remove require() cache on watch???
     - otherwise changing source code does not reload it
  - X-Response-Time
  - fix deleted ICOs still showing up: https://trello.com/c/rQuTpeyV/86-deleted-icos-are-still-available-in-the-ico-details-page-url
  - blog post about test-openapi
  - integration testing
     - also test middleware (not only endpoints)
  - refactoring:
     - make status codes more consistent and hide behind a common interface
     - refactor authentication to simplify it
  - migrations:
     - check production database matches our data model (perform live queries to fix it otherwise)
     - automated system that syncs staging database with production database
     - system to perform and test migrations against production database
  - add a model layer between controller and Mongoose:
     - provide caching invalidation functionality
     - provide ICO slug update functionality
     - make any DELETE flag the model as deleted, but not removed from database
  - upgrade node.bcrypt.js to fix security vulnerability (when they release a version)
  - Gulp buildwatch crashes (does not watch anymore) after the first OpenAPI error
  - switch Jasmine to Jest, like in front-end
  - Node 10
  - 404 are HTML even in JSON
  - add Flow
  - RSS/Atom
  - generate client SDKs from OpenAPI: JavaScript, Bash, others
  - update API documentation to Widdershins
 Â - replace current dependency REQUEST by CROSS-FETCH
  - lint-staged currently does not allow committing only half of a file
  - use declarative way (with JSON-SCHEMA-MOCKER) instead of current approach for populating scripts
  - create fake|test database from OpenAPI:
     - can maybe specify in OpenAPI if a specific type of data is prefered
        - e.g. at least one user should be admin
        - can use faker, etc.
     - can replace populating scripts
     - can be merged with the test populating task at beginning of integration tests
  - use JSON schema instead of joi:
     - probably using SWAY.validateRequest|Response()
     - first use JSON schema during integration testing, then suggesting merging
        - maybe use enjoi as transition
     - possible advantages of JSON schemas:
        - declarative:
           - can be communicated to clients so they can validate before sending to APIs
              - there are even library to generate <form> and <input>
           - schema is data not code, i.e. easier to manipulate for other purpose
              - e.g. can be used for auto-documentation
        - we do not want to be loose on validation with sanitization, but fail hard instead
           - joi is built as sanitizer, e.g. every validation creates a deep copy
        - not JavaScript-specific
        - https://github.com/icebob/validator-benchmark
     - also validate response
     - also parse request parameters
  - replace server-driven populating by client-driven populating:
     - first refactor populating so that each route declaratively specify which models to populate instead of
       doing it imperatively
     - then let clients decide it with a query parameter instead of declaring it on the routes
     - same for:
       - filter
       - aggregation
       - pagination
       - sorting
       - population
  - generate Mongoose models from OpenAPI specification
  - add GraphQL:
     - swagger-to-graphql would allow automating it while still supporting REST
     - I estimated it at 2 days of work
  - other possible uses of OpenAPI:
     - server-side routing
     - web automation
     - mock server
  - yamllint

To do (front-end app):
  - keep .editorconfig in sync with back-end one

Ideas:
  - gamification:
     - simple overall/aggregate ranking number
     - widget/badges showing "certified by"
     - rankings, "best of the week"
     - think of potentialpark
