Doing:
Continue adding base for integration testing

Integration testing:
  - clear error message when fail to initially load spec
  - it makes sense to use Gulp-Jasmine only if it can be run in watch mode and
    trigger only tests of files being changed
     - otherwise should use execCommand()
  - parallelism:
     - one it() per OPERATION + RESP
        - it("METHOD /PATH should respond with STATUS_CODE")
           - METHOD and /PATH should be padded left
        - do not use any describe()
     - inside each it() run several HTTP requests:
        - all at same time (Promise.all()-like)
        - can have several RESP.x-test-params
        - each RESP.x-test-param itself generates several runs:
           - data-driven test: generates data using PARAM JSON schema
           - using JSON-SCHEMA-FAKER
           - should try:
              - keep one third of optional values undefined
              - keep one third of arrays empty
              - keep arrays small even if high maxItems
              - arrays should never have duplicate ids
              - stop populating new array elements when cannot anymore because uniqueItems or no more ids
           - add fuzzy testing values???
     - if any HTTP request fails, whole it() fails:
        - should only show first failure
        - other HTTP requests should be canceled
           - if cannot, try to at least unref() them
        - error message should show both the specific RESP.x-test-param and the generated value
     - should run all it() in parallel
        - in different microloops (for async parallelism)
        - in different processes (for CPU parallelism)
        - maybe switch to ava to get that
     - should limit number of concurrent HTTP requests while still maximize it
        - try to guess the value???
  - RESP.x-test-params OBJ_ARR:
     - def OBJ_ARR: [{}]
        - only for 2** responses
     - key can be:
        - '[IN_]PARAM_NAME'
        - '[TYPE_]SEC_NAME'???
        - 'schema|headers':
           - like RESP.schema|headers but for those possible params
           - combined as union (not intersection nor override) of RESP.schema|headers
           - "schema|headers" should never be considered a possible parameter name, unless prefixed with "TYPE_"
     - value (unless schema|headers) can be:
        - any VAL (including not specified)
        - 'any': random possible value
        - 'error': random not possible value
        - a JSON schema???
           - maybe:
              - if value is OBJ (not ARR), consider it a JSON schema
              - unless parameter type is object, in which case recurse that logic but on its properties
     - def param value (unless schema|headers):
        - non-required query|headers and SECURITY params: undefined
        - otherwise: use possible value
        - allow overriding OBJ properties???
     - use PATHDEF|OPERATION.parameters, PARAM.name|in
        - and SPEC|OPERATION.security, SPEC.securityDefinitions
     - should allow specifying (outside specification) SECURITY PARAMs for all requests
        - think of making it work with authentication
     - gulp openapi should validate x-test-params
  - HTTP request:
     - use CROSS-FETCH (not FRISBY)
        - maybe replace current dependency REQUEST by CROSS-FETCH too
     - fix host|port???
        - I had to comment it out because requiring 'src/config' creates problem with gulp unitTest
           - maybe require('src/config') should be inside gulp integrationTest function
        - current host|port might not work on other environment, e.g. stage???
     - Content-Type [C] and Accept [C] according to SPEC|OPERATION.consumes|produces
  - Validation:
     - RESP STATUS_CODE
     - RESP.[x-test-params.*.]schema
     - RESP.[x-test-params.*.]headers.HEADER:
        - key is present??? how to validate optional header's value???
        - value matches SCHEMA
     - Content-Type [S], Accept [S] against SPEC|OPERATION.produces
     - check SWAY's validateResponse()
     - what to do with 'file' PARAMs???
        - OPENAPI-SCHEMA-TO-JSON-SCHEMA throws on them
     - should also validate PARAM.allowEmptyValue
        - it is removed by OPENAPI-SCHEMA-TO-JSON-SCHEMA
  - Parsing|serializing:
     - parsing RESP.headers
     - serializing PARAM
     - including collectionFormat
     - check SWAY's convertValue() and validateResponse()
     - check SWAGGER-JS
  - Global state:
     - before all tests, connect and create new database.
       At end of all tests (including if failed or uncaught exception), delete that database and disconnect)
     - servers and databases must be running???
  - test database populating:
     - reason: tests should not share state:
        - tests here means not only each it() but any HTTP request
     - at beginning of integration testing:
        - use SPEC.definitions for the list of models???
        - use databaseAdapter.create(OBJ_ARR)???
           - probably use MongoDB native driver, not Mongoose
     - each HTTP request should get its own set of models:
        - i.e. models related to each other but not to other sets of models
        - should be NUM models per model type, where NUM is hard-coded
  - relations:
     - faking/mocking ids:
        - need to:
           - be valid id syntax
              - what about id that are URLs with id at end???
           - point to real model
        - for:
           - path PARAM
           - query|header|body|formData PARAM
           - test data populating
              - should it be translated to JSON schema enum with possible ids to fake???
           - including deep properties
        - how to know???
           - format 'id'???
           - x-relation 'MODEL'???
           - if part of JSON schema, can specify like "not an ID" or "either an ID or ..."
     - populating relations:
        - what about nested/denormalized relations???
           - some might be able to also be created top-level, some not
        - what about relations that can either be an id or a populated relation???
           - depending on whether in input or in output
           - depending on other parameters, e.g. 'populate' variable
     - ids when populating test data:
        - should decide model ids server-side
           - e.g. using databaseAdapter.getId() and databaseAdapter.idName
              - or getId() should be JSON schema instead???
        - then re-use ids only of other models within same set of models
     - path PARAM:
        - should probably default to be considered an id???
  - how to handle sequence of endpoints (e.g. handshake like OAuth)???
  - also test middleware (not endpoints)
  - Explore:
     - fake data
     - data-driven tests
     - fuzzy testing
     - stress testing
     - load testing
     - test coverage
     - test runners, reporting
  - future features:
     - add support for schemes:
        - use both SPEC.schemes and OPERATION.schemes
        - one test per scheme
        - ws[s]:
     - add support for OAuth2

To do:
  - integration testing
  - Node 9
  - consider if can use OpenAPI 3.0
  - fix configuration, it's a little messy
     - implies learning about configuration tools first
  - add Flow
  - RSS/Atom
  - generate client SDKs from OpenAPI: JavaScript, Bash, others
  - update API documentation to Widdershins
  - lint-staged currently does not allow committing only half of a file
  - create fake|test database from OpenAPI:
     - can maybe specify in OpenAPI if a specific type of data is prefered
        - e.g. at least one user should be admin
        - can use faker, etc.
     - can replace populating scripts
     - can be merged with the test populating task at beginning of integration tests
  - use JSON schema instead of joi:
     - probably using SWAY.validateRequest|Response()
     - first use JSON schema during integration testing, then suggesting merging
        - maybe use enjoi as transition
     - possible advantages of JSON schemas:
        - declarative:
           - can be communicated to clients so they can validate before sending to APIs
              - there are even library to generate <form> and <input>
           - schema is data not code, i.e. easier to manipulate for other purpose
              - e.g. can be used for auto-documentation
        - we do not want to be loose on validation with sanitization, but fail hard instead
           - joi is built as sanitizer, e.g. every validation creates a deep copy
        - not JavaScript-specific
        - https://github.com/icebob/validator-benchmark
     - also validate response
     - also parse request parameters
  - replace server-driven populating by client-driven populating:
     - first refactor populating so that each route declaratively specify which models to populate instead of
       doing it imperatively
     - then let clients decide it with a query parameter instead of declaring it on the routes
     - same for:
       - filter
       - aggregation
       - pagination
       - sorting
       - population
  - generate Mongoose models from OpenAPI specification
  - add GraphQL:
     - swagger-to-graphql would allow automating it while still supporting REST
     - I estimated it at 2 days of work
  - other possible uses of OpenAPI:
     - server-side routing
     - web automation
     - mock server
  - yamllint

To do (front-end app):
  - keep .editorconfig in sync with back-end one

Ideas:
  - gamification:
     - simple overall/aggregate ranking number
     - widget/badges showing "certified by"
     - rankings, "best of the week"
     - think of potentialpark
